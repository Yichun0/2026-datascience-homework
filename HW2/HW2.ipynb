After square rooted the values, a “typical” day’s temperature is about 15°F above or below the yearly average is reasonable. Same as the percipitation Since variance is squared, the standard deviation is more accurate in showing the variance within the dataset. It's also more interperable.

    "The P(K) equation for the Poisson distribution evolves the Euler's number which make the numerator of the equation always be greater than 0.  K! will always be greater than 0 also. Therefore, for extreme cases like 12,13,14 in the previous excercise, because they both numberator and the denominator are greater than 0, even if the K! is extremely large, the outcome will still be possitive.
